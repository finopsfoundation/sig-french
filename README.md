## General-purpose SIG Mission Statement

As a FinOps Foundation SIG, the activities of the French SIG are committed to respect the general-purpose missions of the FinOps Foundation SIGs :

1. **Clarify and inform.** Provide valuable and objective information to the TAC, End Users and Projects of the FinOps Foundation regarding areas considered in-scope. Strengthen the project ecosystem to meet the needs of end users and project contributors. Educate and inform users with unbiased, effective, and practically useful information.
1. **Collaborate and interrelate.** Effectively interface with other related groups internal and external to the FinOps Foundation and connect the dots to facilitate meaningful collaborative progression of relevant topics. Engage more communities and create an on-ramp to effective TAC contribution &amp; recognition.
1. **Assist and attract projects.** Helping to maintain the continued health of FinOps Foundation containers-related definitions. Focus attention and resources on helping foster project maturity, systematically across FinOps Foundation projects. Clarify relationship between projects, FinOps Foundation project staff, and community volunteers. Identify gaps in the landscape of FinOps Foundation containers definitions. Find and attract projects to fill these gaps through invitation to present, diligence on proposed projects, and in essence, act as a funnel for TAC project reviews in this area.
1. **Afford impartial stewardship.** Provide and maintain a vendor neutral venue for relevant thought validation, discussion, and project feedback. Establish procedures to assist where necessary.

## Detailed Objectives

- Engage the French Finops user communities by acting as a local Single Point of Contact, liaising with the TAC and other Finops Foundation groups for French-market related topics.
- Promote Finops and Finops Foundation activities in France.
- Educate and inform users with unbiased, effective, and practically useful information.
- Translate, adapt, develop, publish & promote French Finops contents.
- Develop, Maintain and adapt French content into English, where relevant. Specifically, develop, maintain and promote the finops.world web-based best practice framework.
- Ensure proper representation of French community members in the various FinOps Foundation projects, other specific SIGs and staff
- Reduce some project workload on TAC relating for Finops Foundation projects and goals towards French-speaking communities.
- Avoid creating a platform for politics between vendors.
- Provide a ladder for community members to get involved with the technical oversight of FinOps Foundation projects. As part of this, SIGs are expected to actively nurture diverse participation.

# Responsibilities and Deliverables

## Responsibilities

The French SIGs has no direct authority over FinOps Foundation projects.

The French SIGs may choose to spawn focussed and time-limited working groups to achieve some of its responsibilities. Working groups should have a clearly documented charter, timeline (typically a few quarters at most), and set of deliverables. Once the timeline has elapsed, or the deliverables delivered, the working group dissolves, or is explicitly re-chartered.

## Means of action

### General Means & Deliverables

- Organize events online or offline : regular meetups, finops French summit, … 
- Work and sharing meetings
- Training sessions
- Adaptation, translation and publication of Finops Foundation material in French
- Participate in other events to promote Finops and Finops Foundation
-Communicate through the FF website, newsletters, press, social networks and other media.
- Maintain the Finops.world website

### End User Education (Outbound Communication)

- Provide up-to-date, high quality, unbiased and easy-to-consume French material to help end users to understand and effectively adopt cloud-native technologies and practises within the SIG’s area, for example:
  - White papers, presentations, videos, or other forms of training clarifying terminology, comparisons of different approaches, available projects or products, common or recommended practises, trends, illustrative successes and failures, etc.
  - As far as possible, information should be based on research and fact gathering, rather than pure marketing or speculation.

### End User Input Gathering (Inbound Communication)

- Gather and synthetize useful French community end user input and feedback regarding expectations, pain points, primary use cases etc.

### Community Enablement
